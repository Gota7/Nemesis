# Complementary Nemesis
Submission for [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0).
Check out the game's official page [here](https://gota7.itch.io/complementary-nemesis)!
If you like it, please buy the game on the itch.io page so I can fund more cool games in the future (code will always be open sourced)!
You can just play it [here](https://gota7.github.io/Nemesis/) in your browser.
Game is released under studio 7Games but it is all my creation.
